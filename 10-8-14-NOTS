a variable of a super class can refer to or be assigned to an instance of a subclass . but a variable in a subclass cant point to an instance of its super class.

casting -- telling java to treat a variable of one type as another type. ---
Basechar c ;
	(Mage)c
	^^^ treat c like Mage for this line

assigning c2 = m --
c2 doesnt get mages abilities until you cast it 
((Mage)c2).getManna()


private void setName(String name){
	this.name = name;
}
----> this._____ refers to the instance variables/methods of a class

class c {
	private int a;
	public void setA(){
		this.a
}

	x1 = new c()
	x1.setA()

	this.a refers to x1's initial variable a

	x2 = new c()
	x2.setA()

	This.a refers to x2's instance variable a.


public String toString(){
	return this.getName();
}



now we dont have to write "tostring" ever again to get the string representation

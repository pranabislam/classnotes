super class with 1 parameter constructor and subclass with default constructor did not work. ie. name setting in base char didnt name the warrior 

but when the subclass had the 1 param constructor and the super class had the default, it worked. 

when we had a 1 param constructor in both the superclass and the subclass, it didnt work! 

when the super class has the default constructor, and the subclass had 0 params, then it works (the constructor)

0 def works
0 0 works


default in superclass, and when theres both a 0 param and a 1 param in subclass, it works 

0 param in super class with a 1 param also in superclass (overloaded) and a default in subclass doesnt work.

when both sub and super are overloaded with 0 and 1 param constructors, then it works

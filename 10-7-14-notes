	private in healthboost = 5;
	public int getHealth();
		return health;

/* the subclass only has access to public items in the super class

java first looks at the subclass, then looks at the superclass if it cant find something. -- overriding --> when a subclass has a method 
of the same name and signature (parameter types) as the on in the superclass.


in class when doing healthboost for the warrior, he tried super.health

that didnt work because health was private in the superclass.
but he can call the method super.gethealth() and the warriors health boost is returned.
